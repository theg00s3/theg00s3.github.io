                                        <h4> What is my interest in IT? </h4> 
                                        <br>
                                        <p>My interest in IT has been around for as long as I can remember. It was a natural next step for my naturally curious mind, as I was generally the one reading all the manuals I came across so that I could understand how things work. For as long as I can remember I’ve been the dedicated family and friends tech support person, as I found technology intuitive, and generally easy to use. My uncle was an IT inspiration, as he works as a software engineer, which I found incredibly cool. My IT experience is mostly limited to helping friends and family with their phones, computers and other household items, as well as helping people on AirTasker with their technology issues.</p>

                                        <h4> Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I chose to come to RMIT because the Bachelor of Information Technology seemed interesting, and because the campus was in the city. I was previous in my first year of a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Melbourne during 2020, and I was not enjoying my course at all, so I decided to switch courses and universities, as UoM doesn’t offer an IT degree. The course looked engaging, and by virtue of being tech-related, interesting.

                                            <h4>What do I expect to learn during your studies? </h4>
                                            
                                            <p>I expect to learn some programming languages that would be beneficial to have in the current and near-future job market, to learn how to effectively communicate concepts to customers and stakeholders of projects, and to establish industry connections and qualifications that would assist in getting a job.</p>
